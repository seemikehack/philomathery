{"name":"Philomathery","tagline":"We love learning.","body":"## Welcome to Philomathery.\r\nPhilomathery is a syndicate of knowledge seekers who come together to learn, create, and most importantly, share. Visit the blog [here](blog.philomathery.com), or email [michael@philomathery.com](mailto:michael@philomathery.com).\r\n\r\n## What is philomathery?\r\nPhilomathery is a portmanteau of the words _philomath_ and something like _sorcery_ or _tom-foolery_. As it pertains to knowledge and learning, if a polymath possesses much knowledge, then a philomath is someone who delights in the learning thereof.\r\n\r\n## But what _is_ philomathery?\r\nPhilomathery is anything one does for the sake of learning and obtaining knowledge, ideally with the intention of spreading new knowledge to others. There are negative connotations associated with phrases like \"jack of all trades\", but we embrace such ideas and revel in the joy of knowing.\r\n\r\n## How do you even pronounce that?\r\nTechnically, philomath is pronounced `FILL-o-math`, but I like to say `FIE-lo-math`, and the English language is such that you can get away with either as long as you are understood by your intended audience.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
